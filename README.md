# cplus+
A very essential language any or every engineer should be familar and abreast with. <br>
To build a robust software, then assuredly you need this powerful tool.<br>
<sub>**Basic C++ Syntax**</sub>

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string food1 = "pizza";

};
```
> LOL, I like food. <br>
> worth noting: you can either save your file with the .cc or .cpp extension in c++.
